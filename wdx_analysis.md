# World Development Explorer - An Overview
As it explains from the title itself that this report will be consisting of information about some of the very useful statistical and thoroughly researched data by the **World Development Indicators(WDI)**. WDI is an organization that consists of cross country developmental data which comprises of various crucial topics and thousands of indicators, designed to compare the development and note the progress of about 217 countries along with the respective country's history of the past 50 years. 
The various topics that are covered include Poverty & Inequality, Economy, Health, People, Sales and Markets, Global Links etc. There are more the 1400 indicators that can be compared based on the requirement for versatile research purposes by the governments as well as private organizations in planning for several developmental projects to be implemented in the near future for the citizens of their respective countries. This kind of thoroughly researched and accurate data provides wide scope for large administrations in proper decision-making. Furthermore, the following analysis of the World Development Indicator explores a new dimension of research possibility and can be used as a source for further decision making whenever required. 

## A Comprehensive Analysis On Infant Mortality from the periods 1995-2005
According to a report by the World Health Organization, the global deaths of newborns has seen a gradual decrease from 5 Million in 1990 to 2.4 Million in 2019.
The question that arises when we hear the demise of a newborn is, why does it happen? How sad is it that a mother, in her 9 months of pregnancy takes care of her baby as it means the world to her and suddenly she would have to see her baby leave the soul as soon as he/she is born into the world. ***As magical as the miracle of child birth is, equally devastating is the news to a mother that her child is no more***. One of the most destructive situation that no mother in the world should ever face is the death of baby. 
It makes me wonder :
- What causes these deaths?
- Why does the count of infant deaths still keep increasing in some parts of the world?
- How can this count be controlled?
- What steps can be ensured to avoid the small mishaps that occur leading to many deaths in the world?
- Who is responsible for these infant deaths? 

To know the answers to all the questions above, let us analyze a part of data taken from the 
World Development Indicator(WDI) that educates us about the various countries which shows statistical representation of the male and female infant death counts between the years 1995-2005.


 Starting with the year 1995, we can observe the statistical data for 6 countries, namely India, China, United States, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria. Let us have a clear look at the population of these countries first:-

Population of each Country for the Year 1995  

(All the mentioned figures are approximate values)

i. China - 1.2 Billion (Highest Populated)  
ii. India - 963 Million  
iii. United States - 266 Million  
iv. Pakistan - 123 Million  
v. Bangladesh - 115 Million  
vi. Nigeria - 107 Million (Least Populated)  

Now, let us look at the infants death count from the years 1995-2005 using the Line plot.

Male Infant Deaths 1995-2005  

  
From the Lineplots above, we can observe a huge variation in some countries and very low change in some countries in the mortality rate of the infants. Let us look at the statistics of each country elaborately to understand the pattern of these unfortunate deaths of the infants. 

## ***i. CHINA :-  (Represented by the Red Colour in the Lineplot)*** 
### Female Infant Death Analysis:-  
With the population of around 1.2 Billion in the year 1995, the death count of female infants was around 326 Thousand, which is a large number and a matter of high sensitivity. We can observe that the death count in China has signifactly decreased over the span of 10 years. The people and the health officials have been more careful in bringing down this alarming number. Within 5 Years, the number fell down to 230 Thousand when the population went up to 1.26 Billion. At the end of the decade, i.e 2005, there is a gradual decrease in the overall female infant deaths. Though the population increased further to 1.3 Billion, the death count fell to  148 Thousand.
### Male Infant Death Analysis:-  
In 1995, the male infant death count was 412 Thousand which was more than the female count of 326 Thousand. Even the Male Death count had seen a significant change over the decade and at the end of 2005, the death count decreased to 198 Thousand where the overall population was 1.3 Billion. Though this number is more than the female death count, it can be observed that it is still an improved number from where it started. 

## ***ii. INDIA:-  (Represented by the Green Colour in the Lineplot)***
### Female Infant Death Analysis:-   
Being the Second highest populated country after China, India has the worst infant death counts of all the countries in the world. Though the country is still developing at this very moment, India suffered a lot of female infant deaths over the years. In 1995, the Indian population was around 964 Million, which rose rapidly over the decade to 1.1 Billion in 2005. Starting at a whopping 1 Million deaths of female infants in the year 1995, which is the worst number any country would ever imagine to lose, there has been a significant decrease in the number. We can observe that there has been a decrease of almost around 300 Thousand deaths of the female infants every year and stands at 737 Thousand at the end of the decade. i.e.2005. Though this is still a very huge number, considering India to be a developing country and lacking proper health facilities, it could be really difficult to control these menacing numbers.
### Male Infant Death Analysis:-  
Starting at a even more devastating number of 1.1 Million deaths of male infants in the 1995, India managed to control the number over the decade and has seen a similar decrease in the number of deaths and stood at 792 Thousand at the end of 2005. Like the female death count, even the male death count has a decrease of around 300 Thousand per year for the whole decade and in some years it is even more. 

We can see the comparison of both male and female death counts of India from the years 1995-2005 in the below bubble+line plot for a vivid picture.
